Your system is **technically perfect** but needs fresh authentication tokens. Here's exactly how to get them:

3. Click **Submit**

### Step 4: Capture the Request
1. In Network tab, look for a POST request to:
   `transactionentry/505?mk=`
2. **Right-click** on that request
3. Select **Copy as cURL** (or Copy â†’ Copy as cURL)

### Step 5: Save & Update
1. **Paste** the curl command into a new file: `fresh_tokens.sh`
2. Run: `python update_config.py fresh_tokens.sh`
3. Test: `python main.py test`

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll See

**Before (expired tokens):**
```
Result: ðŸ”„ Session expired - redirected to login page
```

**After (fresh tokens):**
```
Result: âœ… Document appears to have been submitted successfully
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Can't find the request?
- Make sure Network tab is recording
- Look for POST requests (not GET)
- The URL should contain `transactionentry/505`

### Curl command looks different?
- That's normal! Cookies change each session
- The important part is the new authentication tokens

### Still getting login page?
- Wait 1-2 minutes after getting tokens
- Make sure you copied the POST request (not GET)
- Try the process again with a fresh browser session

## âœ… Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
1. `python update_config.py fresh_tokens.sh` shows "âœ… Configuration updated"
2. `python main.py test` shows a **different response** (not login page)
3. Debug logs show **new cookie values**

**Your system is ready to process hundreds of documents once you complete this token update!** ðŸŽ‰
